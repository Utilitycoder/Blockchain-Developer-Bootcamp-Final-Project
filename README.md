## Project Description

**Eternal Domain** is a marketplace where users can buy, sell and mint **Eternal Characters**, which are ERC-721 standard (NFT) tokens.

Eternal Characters are the residents of **Eternal Domain** world. They consist of 3 main characteristics, **Area of Control, Weapon and Rank**.

- **Area of Control -** Fire, Wind, Wave, Earth, Light, Shadow, Thunder, Space, Time, Gravity, Ice
- **Weapon -** Sword, Spear, Shield, Hammer, Saber, Axe, Bow, Staff, Wand, Fist, Dagger, Scythe, Mace, Blade, Katana
- **Rank -** Lord, King, Emperor, Venerable, Ancestor, Saint, God

## Workflow

1. Enter the dApp and connect the wallet to rinkeby network.
2. After entering the dApp the user can:
   1. **Buy Characters**
      - Go to the **Home** page and click on the item which user want to buy.
      - User will be redirected to the **BuyNFT** page which shows the price and other details about the item.
      - Click on the **Buy** button to buy the item.
      - Metamask pops up and asks to confirm the transaction for the price of the item.
      - After the transaction is successfully processed user is redirected to the **My NFT** page.
      - The bought item is displayed under the **Bought Characters** section
   2. **Mint Characters**
      - Go to the mint page and click on the **Mint Character** button.
      - Metamask pops up and asks to confirm the transaction.
      - After the transaction is successfully processed the user can see the minted character.
      - The minted character is also added to **My NFT** page under **Minted Characters** section.
   3. **Sell Characters**
      - Go to the **My NFT** page and click on the **Sell** button under the minted item which user want to sell.
      - User will be redirected to the **SellNFT** page where user can enter the price for the item.
      - After entering the desired price, click on the **Sell** button to list the item in the market place.
      - Metamask pops up and asks to confirm the transaction for the listing price.
      - After the transaction is successfully processed user is redirected to the **Home** page.
      - The item will be listed in the marketplace to be bought for the price entered by the user.

## Clone, Install and Build steps

### Prerequisites

1. [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
2. [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/) (everything was installed and tested under v15.12.0)
3. A Browser with the [MetaMask extension](https://metamask.io/) installed.
4. Test Ether on the Rinkeby network.

<br>

### Cloning and installing dependencies

1. Clone the project repository on your local machine

```
 git clone https://github.com/AbhinavXT/blockchain-developer-bootcamp-final-project.git

 cd blockchain-developer-bootcamp-final-project
```

2. Installing dependencies

- For contracts -
  ```
  npm install
  ```
- For client -
  ```
  cd client
  npm install
  ```

### Testing Contracts

For testing contracts run command:

```
npx hardhat test
```

### Running the frontend

For running frontend locally run command:

```
cd client
npm run dev
```

### Deploying and running against a local instance

1. For deploying and running the dApp against a local instance run commands:

```
npx hardhat node
```

2. This should create a local network with 19 accounts. Keep it running, and in another terminal run:

```
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
```

3. When the deployment is complete, the CLI should print out the addresses of the contracts that were deployed:

```
nftMarket contract deployed to: 'EternalMarketplace contract address'

nft contract deployed to: 'EternalNFT contract address'
```

4. Copy these addresses and paste them in the [**config.js**](https://github.com/AbhinavXT/blockchain-developer-bootcamp-final-project/blob/main/client/config.js) file inside the client floder, in place of current addresses.
```
export const nftMarketAddress = 'EternalNFT contract address'

export const nftContractAddress = 'EternalMarketplace contract address'
```

5. For importing account to metamask

   1. Import account using private key from one of the accounts that were logged on running `npx hardhat node`
   2. Create a custom network (if not already there) pointing to http://127.0.0.1:8545 with **chainId 1337**
   3. Switch to this network and connect it to the dApp and reload it.
   6. For better testing of the transfer of tokens and transactions import at least 2 accounts*_
   7. For changing chainId and other possible errors see [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting)

6. Now run the frontend locally in another terminal using command:

```
cd client
npm run dev
```
After this you can run and test the dApp locally in your web browser.

### Environment variables (not needed for running project locally)
```
INFURA_RINKEBY_URL =
ACCOUNT_KEY =
```

## Troubleshooting
### For custom chainId
The default chainId for network localhost8545 is 1337. To change the chainId, the user should follow these steps :
1. Change the chainId in networks under hardhat in [hardhat.config.js](https://github.com/AbhinavXT/blockchain-developer-bootcamp-final-project/blob/main/hardhat.config.js) file.
```
hardhat: {
  chainId: 1337,
}
```
2. After this the user needs to change the devChainId in the [_app.js](https://github.com/AbhinavXT/blockchain-developer-bootcamp-final-project/blob/main/client/pages/_app.js) file on line 61 and 86 under the functions **connectWallet()** and **checkCorrectNetwork()** respectively.
```
const devChainId = 1337
```
  
### For 'Nonce too High' Error 
While testing the dApp on against a local instance, if you get the **Nonce too high** error in the hardhat node terminal or the UI does not show processing your transaction after confirming a transaction, try **resetting your metamask account**. This can be done by going to **Settings > Advanced > Reset Account** in Metamask.

## TODO
- Using oracle for on chain randomness in generating NFTs
- Selling feture for bought eternal items
